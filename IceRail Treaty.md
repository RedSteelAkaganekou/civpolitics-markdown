2. a channel for exclusive discussion of transport routes (ice, horse, or rail) in which any member territory and agreed upon non member territories may request permission for a rail route under or on territory of a member nation
   * 2.1. if the member states agree on a transport route they may request or require a specific rail standar be followed
3. a channel for relay of snitches within range public transport lines
4. all of the above shall then be listed on this document
5. whatever is agreed upon may later be changed by a consensus


(b) to that end each member must: 
1. provide a namelayer group for reinforcement of ice roads and snitches within range of transport routes inside their territory
2. provide reinforce and bypass reinforcement permissions on said group temporaly to workers within their borders upon agreeing on providing permission for a transport route as per (a)2
3. document all public transportation routes that go through, start at, or end in their territory for all other members to see


(c) to that end each member may
1. create a shakira relay in the channel agreed upon in (a)3 for snitches in public international routes within their territory
